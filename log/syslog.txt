III â€“ What is Syslog message format?
The syslog format is divided into three parts:
    PRI part: that details the message priority levels (from a debug message to an emergency) as well as the facility levels (mail, auth, kernel);
    HEADER part: composed of two fields which are the TIMESTAMP and the HOSTNAME, the hostname being the machine name that sends the log;
    MSG part: this part contains the actual information about the event that happened. It is also divided into a TAG and a CONTENT field.

Here are the Syslog facility levels described in a table:
