buildmode 
	The 'go build' and 'go install' commands take a -buildmode argument which
	indicates which kind of object file is to be built. Currently supported values
	are:
	
// go .a 编译
		-buildmode=default
			Listed main packages are built into executables and listed
			non-main packages are built into .a files (the default
			behavior).

// 静态编译
		-buildmode=archive
			Build the listed non-main packages into .a files. Packages named
			main are ignored.
	
		-buildmode=c-archive
			Build the listed main package, plus all packages it imports,
			into a C archive file. The only callable symbols will be those
			functions exported using a cgo //export comment. Requires
			exactly one main package to be listed.
	
// 动态编译
		-buildmode=shared
			Combine all the listed non-main packages into a single shared
			library that will be used when building with the -linkshared
			option. Packages named main are ignored.

		-buildmode=c-shared
			Build the listed main packages, plus all packages that they
			import, into C shared libraries. The only callable symbols will
			be those functions exported using a cgo //export comment.
			Non-main packages are ignored.
	
	
		-buildmode=exe
			Build the listed main packages and everything they import into
			executables. Packages not named main are ignored.
	
		-buildmode=pie
			Build the listed main packages and everything they import into
			position independent executables (PIE). Packages not named
			main are ignored.
